# Iteration 3

## Local Chat with Codex-Medium - Step 1

### Instruction

Transform the following bullet-point instructions into a written paragraph :

Title: Design System & Tokens
Why: Ensure accessible, consistent UI and faster delivery.
Scope:
	•	Frontend: Set design tokens (color/typography/spacing), base components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast), dark mode, WCAG AA defaults.
	•	Backend: Serve feature flag for theme experiments.
	•	Infra: Storybook with a11y, Chromatic/visual tests in CI.
Acceptance Criteria:
	•	AC1 : Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing.
	•	AC2: Visual regression job runs in CI and fails on diffs above threshold.
	•	AC3 : Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.

### Output

For the Design System & Tokens workstream, focus on establishing an accessible, consistent UI that accelerates delivery. On the frontend, define the core design tokens—covering color, typography, and spacing—alongside foundational components such as Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast, ensuring dark-mode support and WCAG AA defaults. On the backend, expose a feature flag that lets teams experiment with theme variations. Infrastructure should deliver a Storybook setup with built-in accessibility checks and Chromatic-powered visual regression tests wired into CI. Success looks like: Storybook listings of tokens and components passing their accessibility checks, the visual regression job blocking merges when diffs exceed the approved threshold, and keyboard navigation plus focus states on the key components meeting WCAG AA.
