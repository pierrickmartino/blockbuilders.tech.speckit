Title: 003-Design System & Tokens
Why: Ensure accessible, consistent UI and faster delivery.
Scope:
	•	Frontend: Set design tokens (color/typography/spacing), base components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast), dark mode, WCAG AA defaults.
	•	Backend: Serve feature flag for theme experiments.
	•	Infra: Storybook with a11y, Chromatic/visual tests in CI.
Acceptance Criteria:
	•	AC1 : Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing.
	•	AC2: Visual regression job runs in CI and fails on diffs above threshold.
	•	AC3 : Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.
