# Tasks: Initial Technical Skeleton (Mono-Repo)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/  
**Tests**: Create only where required by the specification (this feature mandates frontend Vitest + Playwright smoke and backend pytest coverage).

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish repo-level tooling so apps can be bootstrapped consistently.

- [ ] T001 Create root workspace manifest with metadata and pnpm toolchain scripts in `package.json`
- [ ] T002 Declare workspace package locations for frontend and backend in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- [ ] T003 Pin Node.js 20.11 runtime for contributors in `.nvmrc`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Shared prerequisites required before implementing any user story.

- [ ] T004 Define ignore patterns for Node, Python, and Docker artefacts in `.gitignore`
- [ ] T005 Create reusable git metadata collector script emitting version/commit/timestamp in `shared/scripts/collect-build-metadata.sh`
- [ ] T006 Document environment variable contract spanning both services in `configs/ENVIRONMENT.md`

**Checkpoint**: Shared tooling in placeâ€”frontend and backend implementation can now proceed.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Launch baseline web client (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Deliver a Next.js landing page that surfaces build metadata with Tailwind styling.  
**Independent Test**: Follow quickstart to run `pnpm dev --filter apps/frontend...` and verify the root route renders metadata attributes without console errors; Playwright smoke succeeds.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Verify service health contract (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Deliver FastAPI health endpoint honoring OpenAPI contract with typed responses.  
**Independent Test**: Run backend dev server via `uv run fastapi dev apps/backend/app/main.py --reload`, invoke `/health`, and confirm 200 JSON matches schema; pytest suite passes with coverage.

- [ ] T049 [P] [US3] Capture frontend/backend container cold start timings in CI and store artifact summary in `configs/ci/reports/container-start-times.md`

**Checkpoint**: Tooling parity confirmedâ€”local and CI workflows enforce guardrails for both services.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation and validation tasks that span all stories.

- [ ] T043 Compile troubleshooting matrix for frontend/backend services in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- [ ] T044 Capture validated quickstart walkthrough aligning commands with reality and highlight CI timing/latency evidence in `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- [ ] T045 Record release readiness checklist covering tests, coverage, and container scans in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (Phase 1)** â†’ **Foundational (Phase 2)** â†’ **User Stories (Phases 3â€“5)** â†’ **Polish (Phase 6)**.
- User Story 1 depends on shared metadata script (T005) and workspace scaffolding (T001â€“T006); complete Phase 3 before starting US2 or US3 if working sequentially.
- User Story 2 depends on metadata script (T005) for version parity and on backend package scaffolding (T024) before routers/tests can pass.
- User Story 3 depends on both application stories to define build/test targets prior to wiring CI and containers.
- Polish tasks require all user stories to be complete to capture accurate documentation.

---

## Parallel Opportunities

- Tasks marked `[P]` within a phase touch independent files (e.g., T010â€“T015 in frontend, T025â€“T027 in backend) and can be split among contributors once prerequisite items in the same phase finish.
- After Phase 2 completes, User Story 1 and User Story 2 can run in parallel teams, with User Story 3 starting once each service exposes stable commands.
- CI workflow authoring (T039, T040) can proceed in parallel with Dockerfile tasks (T036, T037) because they operate on separate directories.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Parallel tests
# T007 vs T008 (baseline Vitest + Playwright) target separate files and can be developed concurrently.
# T050 layers fallback coverage once baseline metadata rendering is in place.

# Parallel implementation
# T010â€“T015 cover tsconfig, next.config, tailwind config, env loader, and metadata helper.
# Assign each to different engineers while coordinating on shared conventions defined in T009.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Setup and Foundational phases (T001â€“T006).  
2. Deliver User Story 1 (T007â€“T021, T050â€“T051) and validate via `pnpm dev`, Vitest, and Playwright.  
3. Demo landing page metadata to stakeholders before expanding scope.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Ship User Story 1 as the MVP.  
2. Add User Story 2 (T022â€“T031) to expose health endpoint and pytest coverage.  
3. Layer in User Story 3 (T032â€“T042) for guardrails and automation.  
4. Finish with cross-cutting polish (T043â€“T045).

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. Pair focus: One team drives User Story 1 while another handles User Story 2 after foundational work.  
2. A third contributor can begin User Story 3 once both app stories expose stable commands, coordinating on Makefile and CI definitions.  
3. Reconvene to complete Polish tasks ensuring documentation matches delivered workflows.
