# Feature Specification: Initial Technical Skeleton (Mono-Repo)

**Feature Branch**: `001-bootstrap-monorepo`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Title: Initial technical skeleton (mono-repo) Why: Establish fast iteration loop with tests & CI; no product features yet. Scope: - Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript + TailwindCSS; ESLint + Prettier; Vitest/Playwright smoke tests; basic / page with build info. - Backend: FastAPI + Uvicorn; Pydantic v2; pytest; health endpoint GET /health returning {status:ok}. - Tooling: pnpm workspace for Frontend, uv or poetry for Backend; Dockerfiles for both; docker-compose for local dev; Makefile targets (dev, test, lint). - CI: GitHub Actions for lint + test on push; build containers. Non-Goals: No auth, no persistence beyond in-memory; no deployment. Acceptance Criteria: - `pnpm dev` runs Frontend at /; `uv run fastapi dev` (or `make dev`) serves Backend at /health. - `pnpm test` and `pytest` green in CI. - Repo READMEs document how to run locally."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Launch baseline web client (Priority: P1)

Product engineers need to install dependencies and start the web client skeleton so they can confirm a working baseline and view build metadata on the landing page.

**Why this priority**: A visible, functioning web entry point is the fastest way to validate the stack and unblock UI iteration. Without it, the skeleton provides no tangible value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following the quick-start instructions to launch the web client locally and validating the root page renders the expected build information without runtime errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh clone with documented prerequisites installed, **When** the engineer runs the published development command, **Then** the local site loads at the default route and displays current build metadata (version, commit, environment) without console errors.
2. **Given** the web client is running locally, **When** an automated smoke test hits the landing page, **Then** the response confirms the page renders successfully and exposes the build metadata fields.

### User Story 2 - Verify service health contract (Priority: P2)

Platform engineers need to start the API service and confirm the health endpoint returns the agreed success payload so downstream automation can trust service availability.

**Why this priority**: A reliable health contract is foundational for monitoring, CI checks, and future service integrations; without it, the backend skeleton cannot be trusted.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the documented API start command and issuing a request to the health endpoint, verifying it returns an HTTP 200 with `status: "ok"` and no stack traces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the repository dependencies are installed, **When** the engineer runs the published backend start command, **Then** the service responds on the expected port with a `status: "ok"` payload at the health route.
2. **Given** the backend service is running, **When** automated tests or CI pipelines call the health endpoint, **Then** the response is received within one second and contains no error or debug data.

### User Story 3 - Guardrails for fast iteration (Priority: P3)

Engineers need documented workflows that run automated linting, unit tests, and smoke checks locally and in CI so they can iterate quickly with confidence the skeleton remains stable.

**Why this priority**: Repeatable quality gates and container artifacts prevent regressions and align the team on consistent tooling before product features begin.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the documented lint and test commands locally, running the corresponding CI pipeline, and building the provided container images to confirm they succeed without manual tweaks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the engineer has followed the setup instructions, **When** they execute the documented lint and test commands, **Then** all checks pass consistently on both macOS and Linux without additional configuration.
2. **Given** a push to a feature branch, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** it executes linting, unit tests, and container builds, reporting pass/fail status without manual intervention.

### Edge Cases

- Engineers working on different operating systems (macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Linux) must be able to run all documented commands without path or shell issues.
- Local services should provide clear guidance when required environment variables or dependencies are missing, instead of failing silently.
- Landing page build metadata must degrade gracefully if git metadata is unavailable (e.g., detached HEAD, CI environment).
- Health endpoint should surface actionable errors if the service fails to start or dependency checks fail, enabling quick diagnosis.
- Container builds must fail fast with human-readable errors if prerequisites (e.g., container runtime) are absent, preventing ambiguous CI failures.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Platform MUST provide a mono-repository structure that clearly separates web client and API services while sharing common tooling (Principles: simplicity, quality). Verified by repository tree review and onboarding walkthrough.
- **FR-002**: Web client MUST expose a landing page that surfaces current build metadata (commit identifier, version, environment) for quick verification (Principles: experience, quality). Verified by manual smoke test and automated UI check.
- **FR-003**: API service MUST expose a health endpoint returning an `ok` status payload and successful HTTP status to indicate readiness (Principles: quality, performance). Verified by automated API test and CI probe.
- **FR-004**: Repository MUST include documented commands to install dependencies, run development servers, execute linting, and run automated tests for both services (Principles: simplicity, testing). Verified by README walkthrough and successful command execution logs.
- **FR-005**: Automated test suites (unit, component, smoke) MUST execute locally and in CI, providing pass/fail signals without manual setup (Principles: testing, quality). Verified by local run logs and CI reports.
- **FR-006**: Container definitions and a compose configuration MUST enable local orchestration of all services to mirror production topology (Principles: performance, simplicity). Verified by successful container build and compose up execution.
- **FR-007**: Continuous integration workflows MUST run linting, testing, and container builds on every push, blocking merges on failure and surfacing actionable logs (Principles: quality, testing). Verified by CI pipeline configuration and run history.
- **FR-008**: Repository documentation MUST guide developers through prerequisites, setup time expectations, troubleshooting steps, and common tasks within 15 minutes of reading (Principles: experience, simplicity). Verified by onboarding dry run feedback.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Build Snapshot**: Represents the set of metadata displayed on the landing page (commit identifier, version string, environment label, timestamp) to confirm the build provenance.
- **Service Health Status**: Represents the health response contract (`status` value and optional diagnostics) consumers use to assess API readiness.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-ENV**: New engineers can complete environment setup and run both services locally in under 30 minutes following the README, as confirmed by onboarding dry run feedback.
- **SC-TEST**: Local lint and automated test suites execute end-to-end in under five minutes and pass on both macOS and Linux reference machines, with matching success in CI pipelines.
- **SC-VIS**: Landing page consistently displays up-to-date build metadata during manual review and automated smoke runs across three consecutive builds.
- **SC-OPS**: Health endpoint responds with a successful status and under one second latency across five consecutive CI checks, providing confidence for future monitoring hooks.

## Assumptions

- Engineering team has standardized on the listed tooling stack for this skeleton and will refine implementation details during planning.
- No user-facing product features are required in this iteration; effort focuses solely on developer experience and operational readiness.
- External integrations (databases, third-party APIs) are explicitly out of scope until future features request them.
