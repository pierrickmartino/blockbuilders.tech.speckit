## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | C1 | Constitution | CRITICAL | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/tasks.md:46 | Task T014 introduces a zod dependency that is absent from spec/plan, breaching Constitution principle II (no
  undocumented dependencies). | Either document/justify zod in spec & plan, or revise T014 to rely on already-approved tooling. |
  | G1 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/spec.md:84 | Success criterion SC-TEST (tests must finish ≤5 min on macOS/Linux and CI) has no corresponding measurement task. | Add a
  task to record and enforce lint/test runtime (e.g., capture timing in CI and quickstart) or adjust the requirement. |
  | G2 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/spec.md:86 | Success criterion SC-OPS requires /health latency <1 s across five CI runs, but no task instruments or verifies latency. |
  Introduce backend test/monitoring tasks that measure and assert latency thresholds, or refine the criterion. |
  | G3 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/plan.md:24-36 | Plan commits to TTI/LCP/container-start budgets, yet tasks lack instrumentation to collect these metrics. | Add
  frontend (Playwright trace/Next.js build stats) and DevOps tasks to capture and document the stated performance budgets. |
  | G4 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/spec.md:57 | Edge case calls for graceful fallback when git metadata is missing, but tasks omit any implementation or test for that
  behavior. | Extend frontend tasks to implement a fallback state and add a test validating the degraded mode. |
  | I1 | Inconsistency | MEDIUM | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/plan.md:12-16 | Plan retains “ACTION REQUIRED” template guidance, signalling the section was not fully curated for this feature. |
  Clean the placeholder text or confirm the section content is finalized. |
  | I2 | Inconsistency | MEDIUM | specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/tasks.md:111 · specs/001-bootstrap-monorepo/plan.md:44-87 | Tasks expect a docs/ directory (T043–T045), but the plan’s source layout
  omits it, creating structural drift. | Align plan structure with the intended docs outputs or relocate the tasks into documented directories. |

  Next Actions

  - Resolve the CRITICAL constitution breach (update spec/plan for zod or amend T014) before /speckit.implement.
  - Add tasks to verify SC-TEST and SC-OPS performance thresholds.
  - Extend the plan/task set to capture the plan-level performance budgets and the git metadata fallback.
  - Refresh plan.md to remove template placeholders and document the intended docs directory.

  Remediation outline

  1. Document or adjust the zod dependency.
      - Option A: Amend spec.md (FR section) and plan.md (Technical Context) to declare Zod as the chosen schema validator for the frontend env loader, citing Simplicity Over Speculation (justify
        why it’s necessary vs alternatives).
      - Option B: If Zod is overkill, revise T014 to rely on native validation or a shared helper already sanctioned by the plan, and update dependent tasks/tests accordingly.
  2. Add explicit performance-verification tasks for SC-TEST and SC-OPS.
      - Introduce new Phase 5 tasks, e.g.:
          - T0XX “Record lint/test execution time in CI and document evidence in quickstart (SC-TEST).”
          - T0XY “Instrument pytest to log health endpoint latency across five CI runs and persist report (SC-OPS).”
      - Update quickstart or README tasks to incorporate reporting of these measurements.
  3. Capture plan-level performance budgets in tasks.
      - Add tasks under User Story 3 or Polish, e.g. “Collect Next.js build metrics and Playwright performance trace; confirm TTI/LCP targets” and “Document container start times in CI pipeline
        artifacts.”
      - Reference these tasks from the plan’s Constitution Check section to close the loop.
  4. Address the git metadata fallback edge case.
      - Add a frontend implementation task to handle missing git metadata (e.g., default labels) and a matching test task (Vitest/Playwright) to assert graceful degradation.
  5. Align plan structure with docs outputs and remove placeholders.
      - Update plan.md to replace the “ACTION REQUIRED” comment with finalized context.
      - Extend the Project Structure section to include docs/ so T043–T045 map cleanly, or move those tasks to an already documented directory.
