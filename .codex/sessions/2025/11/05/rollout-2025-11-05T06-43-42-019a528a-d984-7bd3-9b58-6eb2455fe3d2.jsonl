Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7.

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Scope: • Frontend: Set design tokens (color/typography/spacing), base components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast), dark mode, WCAG AA defaults. • Backend: Serve feature flag for theme experiments. • Infra: Storybook with a11y, Chromatic/visual tests in CI. Acceptance Criteria: • AC1 : Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing. • AC2: Visual regression job runs in CI and fails on diffs above threshold. • AC3 : Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.\\\"\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Reference accessible design tokens (Priority: P1)\\n\\nProduct squads preparing new surfaces can open the shared design system workspace and select approved color, typography, and spacing tokens that already meet accessibility contrast requirements.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Without agreed tokens, teams continue to ship inconsistent UI and rework grows; this story creates the canonical source of truth.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Confirm that the tokens catalog presents all foundational categories with accessibility annotations and can be consumed to style a new page without bespoke values.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a product designer reviews the design system workspace, **When** they inspect the color tokens, **Then** every core brand color lists approved contrast pairings that satisfy WCAG AA.\\n2. **Given** a developer styling a new screen, **When** they browse the typography and spacing tokens, **Then** they find named options for headings, body copy, and layout rhythm without defining custom values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Ship accessible foundation components (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA front-end engineer adopting the design system can drop in the base Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components and know that focus handling, error states, and messaging already meet accessibility standards in both default and dark themes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: These reusable components remove duplicated effort and lower the risk of accessibility regressions across the product.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Mount each foundation component in isolation, walk through keyboard-only flows, and verify that focus, error, and disabled states match the documented tokens in both themes.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a keyboard-only user interacting with the Button and Input components, **When** they tab through interactive states, **Then** visible focus rings and announcements remain present and meet WCAG AA contrast in default and dark modes.\\n2. **Given** a developer renders the Modal and Toast components, **When** they trigger open, close, and error paths, **Then** focus is trapped appropriately, returns to the invoking element, and status messages are conveyed in accordance with accessibility guidelines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Control theme experiments safely (Priority: P3)\\n\\nProduct stakeholders can enable or disable theme experiments through a configuration flag so that only targeted users see in-progress visual changes while the rest fall back to the default theme.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Feature gating reduces risk when trialing new visuals and allows rapid rollback without code changes.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Toggle the theme flag for a scoped cohort and confirm that exposure updates within the agreed window while unaffected users remain on the baseline experience.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the experiment flag is off, **When** a user outside the test cohort signs in, **Then** they continue to see the baseline theme with documented tokens.\\n2. **Given** the experiment flag is turned on for a pilot cohort, **When** those users refresh the application, **Then** they see the experimental theme while other cohorts remain unchanged.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 4 - Guard visual and accessibility regressions (Priority: P3)\\n\\nQA and design reviewers rely on automated checks to spot visual diffs and accessibility violations before changes merge, preventing regressions in core components.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Automated gatekeeping keeps the design system trustworthy as teams iterate quickly.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Run the automated regression suite on a component change and verify that the job fails when visual or accessibility thresholds are exceeded and provides actionable reports.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a change introduces a visual deviation beyond the agreed tolerance, **When** the regression suite runs, **Then** the job fails and highlights the affected component snapshots.\\n2. **Given** automated accessibility scans detect a new violation in any foundation component, **When** the checks complete, **Then** the build blocks promotion until the issue is resolved or explicitly waived.\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- Theme flag toggled mid-session should not strand users in a partially updated theme; the experience must refresh or gracefully default without broken styles.\\n- Dark mode must respect user system preferences and fall back to default theme if tokens are missing or invalid.\\n- Components must prevent accessibility failures such as focus traps, missing announcements, or insufficient contrast when error states appear simultaneously with overlays.\\n- Visual regression alerts must differentiate between intentional updates (with approved baselines) and unexpected diffs to avoid alert fatigue.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n> Map each requirement to the relevant constitution principle. Explicitly list the tests, telemetry, or UX artefacts that will demonstrate compliance.\\n\\n- **FR-001**: Establish a centralized catalog of color, typography, and spacing tokens with WCAG AA-compliant defaults for light and dark variants (Principles: experience, quality). Evidence: token documentation reviewed and signed off by design and accessibility leads.\\n- **FR-002**: Document usage guidance that links each token to real component examples so teams can adopt them without bespoke styling (Principles: simplicity, experience). Evidence: cross-referenced guidelines in the design system workspace covering at least one example per token category.\\n- **FR-003**: Deliver foundation Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components whose keyboard navigation, focus handling, and announcements meet accessibility expectations in both themes (Principles: quality, testing, experience). Evidence: manual keyboard walkthrough logs and automated accessibility reports showing zero critical issues.\\n- **FR-004**: Provide a dark theme that can be toggled per user preference while maintaining readability and parity with default theme components (Principles: experience, performance). Evidence: visual review checklist confirming parity and accessibility across representative screens.\\n- **FR-005**: Expose a remotely configured flag that controls access to theme experiments, supports cohort targeting, and falls back gracefully when disabled (Principles: quality, simplicity). Evidence: configuration audit showing rollout rules, rollback procedure, and monitoring of flag state changes.\\n- **FR-006**: Enforce automated visual and accessibility regression checks that block release when diffs exceed agreed thresholds or critical violations appear (Principles: testing, quality). Evidence: CI run history with at least one intentionally triggered failure and documented override process.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Design Token**: Named representation of brand-approved styling attributes (color, typography, spacing) including accessibility metadata such as contrast ratios and allowed usage contexts.\\n- **Foundation Component**: Reusable UI building block (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consumes tokens and defines interaction states, accessibility affordances, and theming hooks.\\n- **Theme Experiment Flag**: Configuration control that assigns specific themes to targeted audiences, records state changes, and ensures default fallback when experiments conclude.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Current product teams will adopt the new tokens and components during upcoming UI workstreams without requiring additional staffing.\\n- Accessibility acceptance is based on WCAG 2.2 AA guidance unless regulatory needs escalate beyond that baseline.\\n- Visual regression tolerance levels and approval workflow will be supplied by the design team prior to launch.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Engagement from design and accessibility reviewers to validate tokens, components, and regression reports.\\n- Configuration management access for the team responsible for managing the theme experiment flag.\\n- Continuous integration capacity to run the expanded regression suite on every pull request touching the design system.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-ACCESS**: All documented foundation components and token examples demonstrate zero critical accessibility violations and pass keyboard-only walkthroughs in both themes during launch review.\\n- **SC-CONSISTENCY**: At least five core components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) and the full token catalog are published in the design system workspace with dual-theme previews and usage notes approved by design.\\n- **SC-EXPERIMENT**: Theme experiment flag can be enabled or disabled for a defined cohort with changes taking effect within 10 minutes and rollback confirmed within the same window.\\n- **SC-GUARDRAIL**: Automated visual regression runs on every qualifying change and blocks promotion when pixel variance exceeds the defined tolerance, with alert resolution recorded in release notes.\\nEOF\\n\"],\"workdir\":\"/Users/pierrickmartino/Developer/blockbuilders.tech.speckit\"}","call_id":"call_QDAqBqtsHebGc50sXxm9Nm2r"}}
