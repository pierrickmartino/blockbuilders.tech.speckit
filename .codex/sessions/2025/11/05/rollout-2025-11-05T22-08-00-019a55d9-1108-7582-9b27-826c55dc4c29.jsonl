If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   -

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nCreate a shared design system inside the Next.js 15 frontend: centralize color/typography/spacing tokens as generated Tailwind + CSS variables, build shadcn-based foundation components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consume those tokens, and verify accessibility through Storybook a11y checks and keyboard walkthroughs.\\n\\n## Technical Context\\n\\n**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Next.js 15 App Router, React 19)  \\n**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Storybook 8 with @storybook/addon-a11y, Supabase client (existing auth plumbing), Zod 3  \\n**Storage**: N/A (tokens defined in JSON/TypeScript schema and emitted to CSS variables)  \\n**Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library (unit), Playwright + @axe-core/playwright (smoke/a11y), Storybook test-runner for accessibility regressions  \\n**Target Platform**: Web (Next.js 15, evergreen browsers, SSR + RSC hybrid)  \\n**Project Type**: web  \\n**Performance Goals**: Token gallery and component docs render ≤2.0s TTI / ≤2.5s LCP in CI reference profile; Storybook build completes within existing pipeline SLO (≤8 min)  \\n**Constraints**: Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA contrast/focus, reuse Tailwind tokens + shadcn primitives, avoid new runtime deps without governance review, preserve Supabase auth compatibility  \\n**Scale/Scope**: Shared library for all @blockbuilders/frontend surfaces; initial drop covers full token catalog + 5 foundation components + Storybook docs\\n\\n## Constitution Check\\n\\n- **Code Quality Without Compromise**: Run `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:e2e`, and Storybook accessibility CI (`pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... storybook:test`) prior to implementation sign-off; peer review confirms adherence.\\n- **Simplicity Over Speculation**: Deliverables map directly to FR-001 (token catalog generation), FR-002 (usage guidance + docs), FR-003 (foundation components), and FR-004 (dark theme parity). No additional components or tooling beyond shadcn/ui will ship without an exception.\\n- **Test Evidence First**: Author failing Vitest suites for token utilities and component behaviors, Playwright keyboard smoke tests for each foundation component, and Storybook a11y snapshots before implementation to maintain ≥80% coverage and catch regressions.\\n- **Consistent Experience Every Time**: Implement tokens via Tailwind config and CSS variables consumed by shadcn components, validate with Storybook + @storybook/addon-a11y, and record manual keyboard walkthrough logs against the acceptance scenarios.\\n- **Performance and Reliability Budgets**: Measure Storybook build times, monitor Next.js route performance via existing telemetry dashboards, and capture LCP/TTI metrics in Playwright traces to ensure budgets stay within constitution thresholds.\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/003-design-system-tokens/\\n├── plan.md\\n├── research.md\\n├── data-model.md\\n├── quickstart.md\\n├── contracts/\\n└── tasks.md          # Created by /speckit.tasks after Phase 2\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\napps/\\n├── backend/\\n│   ├── app/\\n│   └── tests/\\n└── frontend/\\n    ├── app/\\n    ├── components/\\n    │   ├── auth/\\n    │   └── design-system/      # new slice for tokens + shadcn foundation components\\n    ├── lib/\\n    │   └── design-system/      # token schema + conversion utilities\\n    ├── styles/\\n    └── tests/\\n\\nconfigs/\\n└── storybook/                  # central Storybook configuration for tokens/components\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Extend the existing Next.js app in `apps/frontend` with a dedicated `design-system` slice for tokens, components, and utilities while keeping backend scope untouched; Storybook config lives under `configs/storybook` for shared CI hooks.\\n\\n## Complexity Tracking\\n\\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| None | N/A | N/A |\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Acceptance Criteria: • AC1: Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing. • AC2: Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.\\\"\\n\\n## Clarifications\\n\\n### Session 2025-11-05\\n\\n- Q: Where should we maintain the canonical token definitions shared between the app and Storybook? → A: Central JSON/TypeScript schema that generates CSS variables and typed exports.\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Reference accessible design tokens (Priority: P1)\\n\\nProduct squads preparing new surfaces can open the shared design system workspace and select approved color, typography, and spacing tokens that already meet accessibility contrast requirements.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Without agreed tokens, teams continue to ship inconsistent UI and rework grows; this story creates the canonical source of truth.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Confirm that the tokens catalog presents all foundational categories with accessibility annotations and can be consumed to style a new page without bespoke values.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a product designer reviews the design system workspace, **When** they inspect the color tokens, **Then** every core brand color lists approved contrast pairings that satisfy WCAG AA.\\n2. **Given** a developer styling a new screen, **When** they browse the typography and spacing tokens, **Then** they find named options for headings, body copy, and layout rhythm without defining custom values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Ship accessible foundation components (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA front-end engineer adopting the design system can drop in the base Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components and know that focus handling, error states, and messaging already meet accessibility standards in both default and dark themes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: These reusable components remove duplicated effort and lower the risk of accessibility regressions across the product.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Mount each foundation component in isolation, walk through keyboard-only flows, and verify that focus, error, and disabled states match the documented tokens in both themes.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a keyboard-only user interacting with the Button and Input components, **When** they tab through interactive states, **Then** visible focus rings and announcements remain present and meet WCAG AA contrast in default and dark modes.\\n2. **Given** a developer renders the Modal and Toast components, **When** they trigger open, close, and error paths, **Then** focus is trapped appropriately, returns to the invoking element, and status messages are conveyed in accordance with accessibility guidelines.\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n- Dark mode must respect user system preferences and fall back to default theme if tokens are missing or invalid.\\n- Components must prevent accessibility failures such as focus traps, missing announcements, or insufficient contrast when error states appear simultaneously with overlays.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n> Map each requirement to the relevant constitution principle. Explicitly list the tests, telemetry, or UX artefacts that will demonstrate compliance.\\n\\n- **FR-001**: Establish a centralized catalog of color, typography, and spacing tokens with WCAG AA-compliant defaults for light and dark variants, maintained in a single JSON/TypeScript schema that emits CSS variables and typed exports for Next.js and Storybook (Principles: experience, quality). Evidence: token documentation reviewed and signed off by design and accessibility leads.\\n- **FR-002**: Document usage guidance that links each token to real component examples so teams can adopt them without bespoke styling (Principles: simplicity, experience). Evidence: cross-referenced guidelines in the design system workspace covering at least one example per token category.\\n- **FR-003**: Deliver foundation Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components whose keyboard navigation, focus handling, and announcements meet accessibility expectations in both themes (Principles: quality, testing, experience). Evidence: manual keyboard walkthrough logs and automated accessibility reports showing zero critical issues.\\n- **FR-004**: Provide a dark theme that can be toggled per user preference while maintaining readability and parity with default theme components (Principles: experience, performance). Evidence: visual review checklist confirming parity and accessibility across representative screens.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Design Token**: Named representation of brand-approved styling attributes (color, typography, spacing) including accessibility metadata such as contrast ratios and allowed usage contexts.\\n- **Foundation Component**: Reusable UI building block (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consumes tokens and defines interaction states, accessibility affordances, and theming hooks.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Current product teams will adopt the new tokens and components during upcoming UI workstreams without requiring additional staffing.\\n- Accessibility acceptance is based on WCAG 2.2 AA guidance unless regulatory needs escalate beyond that baseline.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Engagement from design and accessibility reviewers to validate tokens and components.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-ACCESS**: All documented foundation components and token examples demonstrate zero critical accessibility violations and pass keyboard-only walkthroughs in both themes during launch review.\\n- **SC-CONSISTENCY**: At least five core components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) and the full token catalog are published in the design system workspace with dual-theme previews and usage notes approved by design.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Sync shared tokens to CSS variables: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run tokens:build`\\n\\n## Working with Tokens\\n- Edit token definitions in `apps/frontend/lib/design-system/tokens.ts`\\n- Run `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run tokens:build` to emit `apps/frontend/styles/tokens.css`\\n- Tailwind picks up changes automatically via `tailwind.config.ts` hot reload\\n\\n## Storybook Workflow\\n1. Start Storybook locally: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run storybook`\\n2. Token stories live under `Design System / Tokens`; component stories under `Design System / Components`\\n3. Accessibility addon highlights WCAG violations; check the \\\"Accessibility\\\" panel before marking stories ready\\n4. Run automated checks in CI parity: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run storybook:test`\\n\\n## Testing\\n- Unit tests (Vitest): `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test`\\n- Coverage: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:coverage`\\n- Keyboard + a11y smoke tests (Playwright + axe): `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:e2e --project=design-system`\\n- Lint/type-check: `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` and `pnpm type-check`\\n\\n## Adding a New Component\\n1. Scaffold via shadcn (`pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... exec shadcn add <component>`)\\n2. Replace default CSS classes with token-driven classes using `cn` helper and Tailwind theme extensions\\n3. Document props and states in Storybook with MDX guidelines referencing the relevant tokens\\n4. Extend Playwright spec to cover keyboard and a11y scenarios\\n5. Update `tests/design-system` Vitest suites to assert token usage contracts\\n\\n## Theme Preference\\n- Theme provider auto-reads `prefers-color-scheme`; use the UI toggle to persist overrides\\n- Stored preferences flow through `/users/me/theme-preference`; ensure Supabase session includes the JWT when testing manually\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n","images":[]}}

Code Quality Without Compromise\\n\\n- All code MUST pass automated linting, type-checking, and security scanners before review: `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `ruff check`, and `uv run pytest` are the required baselines.\\n- Vertical-slice architecture, file size limits, and reusable patterns documented in `claude-nextjs-15.md` and `claude-python.md` MUST be followed; deviations require a written exception with compensating controls.\\n- Every pull request MUST document the quality gates exercised and receive peer review that confirms adherence to this constitution before merge.\\n\\nRationale: Enforcing the full quality toolchain and shared architecture prevents regressions, codifies maintainability, and protects the user experience as the system grows.\\n\\n### II. Simplicity Over Speculation\\n\\n- Features MUST trace to approved requirements in `/specs/<feature-id>/spec.md`; work without traceability is removed before implementation starts.\\n- Solutions MUST prefer composition over inheritance, reuse existing utilities, and avoid introducing new dependencies unless a plan documents why existing components are insufficient.\\n- Designs MUST expose only the APIs, components, and configuration needed for the current iteration; speculative hooks are prohibited until a documented user story demands them.\\n\\nRationale: KISS and YAGNI discipline keeps the product understandable, keeps costs predictable, and ensures every abstraction pays for itself immediately.\\n\\n### III. Test Evidence First\\n\\n- Tests MUST be authored before implementation, fail initially, and cover new and changed behavior with a sustained ≥80% statement and branch coverage across web and service code.\\n- Automated accessibility, API contract, and regression tests MUST be included whenever their corresponding surfaces change; missing coverage blocks merge until added.\\n- Continuous integration MUST remain green; any failing pipeline freezes deployment until remediated with root-cause notes linked in the plan or spec.\\n\\nRationale: Treating tests as the contract gives verifiable evidence of correctness, accelerates refactors, and preserves user trust.\\n\\n### IV. Consistent Experience Every Time\\n\\n- UI changes MUST use the shared Tailwind tokens, design primitives, and Next.js 15 server/client boundaries defined in `claude-nextjs-15.md`; ad-hoc styling is prohibited.\\n- All user-visible flows MUST satisfy WCAG 2.2 AA requirements, provide keyboard navigation, maintain focus order, and include accessible alternatives for charts and media.\\n- Specifications MUST document acceptance checks for UX, and delivery MUST demonstrate those checks (automated or manual) prior to handoff.\\n\\nRationale: Consistent, accessible experiences reduce cognitive load, broaden usability, and keep the product aligned with brand expectations.\\n\\n### V. Performance and Reliability Budgets\\n\\n- Web surfaces MUST meet ≤2s Time-to-Interactive and ≤2.5s Largest Contentful Paint on reference devices; backend APIs MUST sustain ≤200ms p95 latency for prioritized routes.\\n- Background workloads (backtests, data ingestion, job runners) MUST expose metrics, alerts, and dashboards; SLO breaches trigger a remediation task in the next iteration.\\n- Each change MUST include a performance validation step—load test, profiling, or telemetry update—that proves the relevant budget remains within thresholds.\\n\\nRationale: Guarding performance and reliability budgets keeps the platform responsive, predictable, and cost-efficient.\\n\\n## Technology Standards\\n\\n- Next.js 15 with React 19 (App Router, Server Components, Turbopack) is the canonical web stack; `pnpm` manages JavaScript dependencies, and shared components live in feature-aligned vertical slices.\\n- Tailwind CSS tokens, generated design primitives, and shadcn-based UI components provide the only approved styling system; custom CSS requires a documented exception.\\n- Python 3.12+ with FastAPI, `uv` for dependency management, and strict Ruff/pytest enforcement is the standard for backend services and automation.\\n- Observability MUST use the shared Datadog dashboards defined in iteration plans; metrics, traces, and logs are mandatory for every service and background worker.\\n- Security artifacts (secrets, compliance runbooks, disclosures) MUST live in version-controlled locations referenced by the relevant iteration documents.\\n\\n## Delivery Workflow\\n\\n- Every initiative starts with a feature specification in `/specs/<feature-id>/spec.md`, capturing user journeys, acceptance criteria, and UX/performance budgets aligned to these principles.\\n- The implementation plan produced via `/speckit.plan` MUST complete the Constitution Check by documenting controls for quality, simplicity, testing, experience, and performance before Phase 0 proceeds.\\n- Tasks generated by `/speckit.tasks` MUST group work by user story, include pre-implementation testing tasks, and explicitly call out performance and accessibility validation steps.\\n- Code reviews MUST verify that artefacts (spec, plan, tasks, telemetry) stay synchronized; deviations trigger immediate updates or create a tracked follow-up task.\\n- Release notes MUST reference the principle compliance evidence (tests run, budgets validated, UX checks) for each shipped story.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\n- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; `claude-nextjs-15.md`, `claude-python.md`, and iteration documents interpret these principles for stack-specific execution.\\n- Amendments require: (1) a written proposal referencing affected principles, (2) updates to dependent templates and guidance, (3) team approval recorded in the repository, and (4) a new Sync Impact Report summarizing changes.\\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking principle changes or removals, MINOR for new principles or material expansions, PATCH for clarifications; every amendment updates the version line and Last Amended date.\\n- Compliance reviews occur at the close of each iteration; any violation produces corrective tasks and, if systemic, triggers a governance retrospective.\\n- The constitution, templates, and referenced guidance undergo a quarterly audit to ensure tooling, frameworks, and metrics remain current with platform upgrades.\\n\\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-29\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Evidence: token documentation reviewed and signed off by design and accessibility leads.\\n    55\\t- **FR-002**: Document usage guidance that links each token to real component examples so teams can adopt them without bespoke styling (Principles: simplicity, experience). Evidence: cross-referenced guidelines in the design system workspace covering at least one example per token category.\\n    56\\t- **FR-003**: Deliver foundation Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components whose keyboard navigation, focus handling, and announcements meet accessibility expectations in both themes (Principles: quality, testing, experience). Evidence: manual keyboard walkthrough logs and automated accessibility reports showing zero critical issues.\\n    57\\t- **FR-004**: Provide a dark theme that can be toggled per user preference while maintaining readability and parity with default theme components (Principles: experience, performance). Evidence: visual review checklist confirming parity and accessibility across representative screens.\\n    58\\t\\n    59\\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n    60\\t\\n    61\\t- **Design Token**: Named representation of brand-approved styling attributes (color, typography, spacing) including accessibility metadata such as contrast ratios and allowed usage contexts.\\n    62\\t- **Foundation Component**: Reusable UI building block (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consumes tokens and defines interaction states, accessibility affordances, and theming hooks.\\n    63\\t\\n    64\\t## Assumptions\\n    65\\t\\n    66\\t- Current product teams will adopt the new tokens and components during upcoming UI workstreams without requiring additional staffing.\\n    67\\t- Accessibility acceptance is based on WCAG 2.2 AA guidance unless regulatory needs escalate beyond that baseline.\\n    68\\t\\n    69\\t## Dependencies\\n    70\\t\\n    71\\t- Engagement from design and accessibility reviewers to validate tokens and components.\\n    72\\t\\n    73\\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n    74\\t\\n    75\\t### Measurable Outcomes\\n    76\\t\\n    77\\t- **SC-ACCESS**: All documented foundation components and token examples demonstrate zero critical accessibility violations and pass keyboard-only walkthroughs in both themes during launch review.\\n    78\\t- **SC-CONSISTENCY**: At least five core components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) and the full token catalog are published in the design system workspace with dual-theme previews and usage notes approved by design.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Code Quality Without Compromise\\n    28\\t\\n    29\\t- All code MUST pass automated linting, type-checking, and security scanners before review: `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `ruff check`, and `uv run pytest` are the required baselines.\\n    30\\t- Vertical-slice architecture, file size limits, and reusable patterns documented in `claude-nextjs-15.md` and `claude-python.md` MUST be followed; deviations require a written exception with compensating controls.\\n    31\\t- Every pull request MUST document the quality gates exercised and receive peer review that confirms adherence to this constitution before merge.\\n    32\\t\\n    33\\tRationale: Enforcing the full quality toolchain and shared architecture prevents regressions, codifies maintainability, and protects the user experience as the system grows.\\n    34\\t\\n    35\\t### II. Simplicity Over Speculation\\n    36\\t\\n    37\\t- Features MUST trace to approved requirements in `/specs/<feature-id>/spec.md`; work without traceability is removed before implementation starts.\\n    38\\t- Solutions MUST prefer composition over inheritance, reuse existing utilities, and avoid introducing new dependencies unless a plan documents why existing components are insufficient.\\n    39\\t- Designs MUST expose only the APIs, components, and configuration needed for the current iteration; speculative hooks are prohibited until a documented user story demands them.\\n    40\\t\\n    41\\tRationale: KISS and YAGNI discipline keeps the product understandable, keeps costs predictable, and ensures every abstraction pays for itself immediately.\\n    42\\t\\n    43\\t### III. Test Evidence First\\n    44\\t\\n    45\\t- Tests MUST be authored before implementation, fail initially, and cover new and changed behavior with a sustained ≥80% statement and branch coverage across web and service code.\\n    46\\t- Automated accessibility, API contract, and regression tests MUST be included whenever their corresponding surfaces change; missing coverage blocks merge until added.\\n    47\\t- Continuous integration MUST remain green; any failing pipeline freezes deployment until remediated with root-cause notes linked in the plan or spec.\\n    48\\t\\n    49\\tRationale: Treating tests as the contract gives verifiable evidence of correctness, accelerates refactors, and preserves user trust.\\n    50\\t\\n    51\\t### IV. Consistent Experience Every Time\\n    52\\t\\n    53\\t- UI changes MUST use the shared Tailwind tokens, design primitives, and Next.js 15 server/client boundaries defined in `claude-nextjs-15.md`; ad-hoc styling is prohibited.\\n    54\\t- All user-visible flows MUST satisfy WCAG 2.2 AA requirements, provide keyboard navigation, maintain focus order, and include accessible alternatives for charts and media.\\n    55\\t- Specifications MUST document acceptance checks for UX, and delivery MUST demonstrate those checks (automated or manual) prior to handoff.\\n    56\\t\\n    57\\tRationale: Consistent, accessible experiences reduce cognitive load, broaden usability, and keep the product aligned with brand expectations.\\n    58\\t\\n    59\\t### V. Performance and Reliability Budgets\\n    60\\t\\n    61\\t- Web surfaces MUST meet ≤2s Time-to-Interactive and ≤2.5s Largest Contentful Paint on reference devices; backend APIs MUST sustain ≤200ms p95 latency for prioritized routes.\\n    62\\t- Background workloads (backtests, data ingestion, job runners) MUST expose metrics, alerts, and dashboards; SLO breaches trigger a remediation task in the next iteration.\\n    63\\t- Each change MUST include a performance validation step—load test, profiling, or telemetry update—that proves the relevant budget remains within thresholds.\\n    64\\t\\n    65\\tRationale: Guarding performance and reliability budgets keeps the platform responsive, predictable, and cost-efficient.\\n    66\\t\\n    67\\t## Technology Standards\\n    68\\t\\n    69\\t- Next.js 15 with React 19 (App Router, Server Components, Turbopack) is the canonical web stack; `pnpm` manages JavaScript dependencies, and shared components live in feature-aligned vertical slices.\\n    70\\t- Tailwind CSS tokens, generated design primitives, and shadcn-based UI components provide the only approved styling system; custom CSS requires a documented exception.\\n    71\\t- Python 3.12+ with FastAPI, `uv` for dependency management, and strict Ruff/pytest enforcement is the standard for backend services and automation.\\n    72\\t- Observability MUST use the shared Datadog dashboards defined in iteration plans; metrics, traces, and logs are mandatory for every service and background worker.\\n    73\\t- Security artifacts (secrets, compliance runbooks, disclosures) MUST live in version-controlled locations referenced by the relevant iteration documents.\\n    74\\t\\n    75\\t## Delivery Workflow\\n    76\\t\\n    77\\t- Every initiative starts with a feature specification in `/specs/<feature-id>/spec.md`, capturing user journeys, acceptance criteria, and UX/performance budgets aligned to these principles.\\n    78\\t- The implementation plan produced via `/speckit.plan` MUST complete the Constitution Check by documenting controls for quality, simplicity, testing, experience, and performance before Phase 0 proceeds.\\n    79\\t- Tasks generated by `/speckit.tasks` MUST group work by user story, include pre-implementation testing tasks, and explicitly call out performance and accessibility validation steps.\\n    80\\t- Code reviews MUST verify that artefacts (spec, plan, tasks, telemetry) stay synchronized; deviations trigger immediate updates or create a tracked follow-up task.\\n    81\\t- Release notes MUST reference the principle compliance evidence (tests run, budgets validated, UX checks) for each shipped story.\\n    82\\t\\n    83\\t## Governance\\n    84\\t\\n    85\\t- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; `claude-nextjs-15.md`, `claude-python.md`, and iteration documents interpret these principles for stack-specific execution.\\n    86\\t- Amendments require: (1) a written proposal referencing affected principles, (2) updates to dependent templates and guidance, (3) team approval recorded in the repository, and (4) a new Sync Impact Report summarizing changes.\\n    87\\t- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking principle changes or removals, MINOR for new principles or material expansions, PATCH for clarifications; every amendment updates the version line and Last Amended date.\\n    88\\t- Compliance reviews occur at the close of each iteration; any violation produces corrective tasks and, if systemic, triggers a governance retrospective.\\n    89\\t- The constitution, templates, and referenced guidance undergo a quarterly audit to ensure tooling, frameworks, and metrics remain current with platform upgrades.\\n    90\\t\\n    91\\t**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-29\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Demo token gallery as standalone MVP before proceeding.\n+\n+### Incremental Delivery\n+\n+1. US1 tokens establish shared styling primitives.  \n+2. US2 components consume tokens, extend backend contracts, and close accessibility/performance validations.  \n+3. Polish phase finalizes rollout, documentation, CI coverage, and quickstart updates.\n+\n+### Parallel Team Strategy\n+\n+1. Pair one engineer on Storybook infrastructure (T003–T005) while another scaffolds ThemeProvider (T006) and quality gates (T007).  \n+2. Split US1 between frontend token schema (T010–T016) and backend contract work (T017–T020), with a dedicated run capturing performance metrics (T021).  \n+3. For US2, distribute components (T026–T030) across engineers, assign backend specialist to T034–T038, and dedicate accessibility/performance reviewers to T024–T025 and T041–T042.\n*** End Patch"}}
