If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   -

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nCreate a shared design system inside the Next.js 15 frontend: centralize color/typography/spacing tokens as generated Tailwind + CSS variables, build shadcn-based foundation components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consume those tokens, and verify accessibility through Storybook a11y checks and keyboard walkthroughs.\\n\\n## Technical Context\\n\\n**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Next.js 15 App Router, React 19)  \\n**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Storybook 8 with @storybook/addon-a11y, Supabase client (existing auth plumbing), Zod 3  \\n**Storage**: N/A (tokens defined in JSON/TypeScript schema and emitted to CSS variables)  \\n**Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library (unit), Playwright + @axe-core/playwright (smoke/a11y), Storybook test-runner for accessibility regressions  \\n**Target Platform**: Web (Next.js 15, evergreen browsers, SSR + RSC hybrid)  \\n**Project Type**: web  \\n**Performance Goals**: Token gallery and component docs render ≤2.0s TTI / ≤2.5s LCP in CI reference profile; Storybook build completes within existing pipeline SLO (≤8 min)  \\n**Constraints**: Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA contrast/focus, reuse Tailwind tokens + shadcn primitives, avoid new runtime deps without governance review, preserve Supabase auth compatibility  \\n**Scale/Scope**: Shared library for all @blockbuilders/frontend surfaces; initial drop covers full token catalog + 5 foundation components + Storybook docs\\n\\n## Constitution Check\\n\\n- **Code Quality Without Compromise**: Run `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:e2e`, and Storybook accessibility CI (`pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... storybook:test`) prior to implementation sign-off; peer review confirms adherence.\\n- **Simplicity Over Speculation**: Deliverables map directly to FR-001 (token catalog generation), FR-002 (usage guidance + docs), FR-003 (foundation components), and FR-004 (dark theme parity). No additional components or tooling beyond shadcn/ui will ship without an exception.\\n- **Test Evidence First**: Author failing Vitest suites for token utilities and component behaviors, Playwright keyboard smoke tests for each foundation component, and Storybook a11y snapshots before implementation to maintain ≥80% coverage and catch regressions.\\n- **Consistent Experience Every Time**: Implement tokens via Tailwind config and CSS variables consumed by shadcn components, validate with Storybook + @storybook/addon-a11y, and record manual keyboard walkthrough logs against the acceptance scenarios.\\n- **Performance and Reliability Budgets**: Measure Storybook build times, monitor Next.js route performance via existing telemetry dashboards, and capture LCP/TTI metrics in Playwright traces to ensure budgets stay within constitution thresholds.\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/003-design-system-tokens/\\n├── plan.md\\n├── research.md\\n├── data-model.md\\n├── quickstart.md\\n├── contracts/\\n└── tasks.md          # Created by /speckit.tasks after Phase 2\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\napps/\\n├── backend/\\n│   ├── app/\\n│   └── tests/\\n└── frontend/\\n    ├── app/\\n    ├── components/\\n    │   ├── auth/\\n    │   └── design-system/      # new slice for tokens + shadcn foundation components\\n    ├── lib/\\n    │   └── design-system/      # token schema + conversion utilities\\n    ├── styles/\\n    └── tests/\\n\\nconfigs/\\n└── storybook/                  # central Storybook configuration for tokens/components\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Extend the existing Next.js app in `apps/frontend` with a dedicated `design-system` slice for tokens, components, and utilities while keeping backend scope untouched; Storybook config lives under `configs/storybook` for shared CI hooks.\\n\\n## Complexity Tracking\\n\\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| None | N/A | N/A |\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Acceptance Criteria: • AC1: Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing. • AC2: Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.\\\"\\n\\n## Clarifications\\n\\n### Session 2025-11-05\\n\\n- Q: Where should we maintain the canonical token definitions shared between the app and Storybook? → A: Central JSON/TypeScript schema that generates CSS variables and typed exports.\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Reference accessible design tokens (Priority: P1)\\n\\nProduct squads preparing new surfaces can open the shared design system workspace and select approved color, typography, and spacing tokens that already meet accessibility contrast requirements.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Without agreed tokens, teams continue to ship inconsistent UI and rework grows; this story creates the canonical source of truth.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Confirm that the tokens catalog presents all foundational categories with accessibility annotations and can be consumed to style a new page without bespoke values.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a product designer reviews the design system workspace, **When** they inspect the color tokens, **Then** every core brand color lists approved contrast pairings that satisfy WCAG AA.\\n2. **Given** a developer styling a new screen, **When** they browse the typography and spacing tokens, **Then** they find named options for headings, body copy, and layout rhythm without defining custom values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Ship accessible foundation components (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA front-end engineer adopting the design system can drop in the base Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components and know that focus handling, error states, and messaging already meet accessibility standards in both default and dark themes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: These reusable components remove duplicated effort and lower the risk of accessibility regressions across the product.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Mount each foundation component in isolation, walk through keyboard-only flows, and verify that focus, error, and disabled states match the documented tokens in both themes.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a keyboard-only user interacting with the Button and Input components, **When** they tab through interactive states, **Then** visible focus rings and announcements remain present and meet WCAG AA contrast in default and dark modes.\\n2. **Given** a developer renders the Modal and Toast components, **When** they trigger open, close, and error paths, **Then** focus is trapped appropriately, returns to the invoking element, and status messages are conveyed in accordance with accessibility guidelines.\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n- Dark mode must respect user system preferences and fall back to default theme if tokens are missing or invalid.\\n- Components must prevent accessibility failures such as focus traps, missing announcements, or insufficient contrast when error states appear simultaneously with overlays.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n> Map each requirement to the relevant constitution principle. Explicitly list the tests, telemetry, or UX artefacts that will demonstrate compliance.\\n\\n- **FR-001**: Establish a centralized catalog of color, typography, and spacing tokens with WCAG AA-compliant defaults for light and dark variants, maintained in a single JSON/TypeScript schema that emits CSS variables and typed exports for Next.js and Storybook (Principles: experience, quality). Evidence: token documentation reviewed and signed off by design and accessibility leads.\\n- **FR-002**: Document usage guidance that links each token to real component examples so teams can adopt them without bespoke styling (Principles: simplicity, experience). Evidence: cross-referenced guidelines in the design system workspace covering at least one example per token category.\\n- **FR-003**: Deliver foundation Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components whose keyboard navigation, focus handling, and announcements meet accessibility expectations in both themes (Principles: quality, testing, experience). Evidence: manual keyboard walkthrough logs and automated accessibility reports showing zero critical issues.\\n- **FR-004**: Provide a dark theme that can be toggled per user preference while maintaining readability and parity with default theme components (Principles: experience, performance). Evidence: visual review checklist confirming parity and accessibility across representative screens.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Design Token**: Named representation of brand-approved styling attributes (color, typography, spacing) including accessibility metadata such as contrast ratios and allowed usage contexts.\\n- **Foundation Component**: Reusable UI building block (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consumes tokens and defines interaction states, accessibility affordances, and theming hooks.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Current product teams will adopt the new tokens and components during upcoming UI workstreams without requiring additional staffing.\\n- Accessibility acceptance is based on WCAG 2.2 AA guidance unless regulatory needs escalate beyond that baseline.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Engagement from design and accessibility reviewers to validate tokens and components.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-ACCESS**: All documented foundation components and token examples demonstrate zero critical accessibility violations and pass keyboard-only walkthroughs in both themes during launch review.\\n- **SC-CONSISTENCY**: At least five core components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) and the full token catalog are published in the design system workspace with dual-theme previews and usage notes approved by design.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Sync shared tokens to CSS variables: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run tokens:build`\\n\\n## Working with Tokens\\n- Edit token definitions in `apps/frontend/lib/design-system/tokens.ts`\\n- Run `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run tokens:build` to emit `apps/frontend/styles/tokens.css`\\n- Tailwind picks up changes automatically via `tailwind.config.ts` hot reload\\n\\n## Storybook Workflow\\n1. Start Storybook locally: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run storybook`\\n2. Token stories live under `Design System / Tokens`; component stories under `Design System / Components`\\n3. Accessibility addon highlights WCAG violations; check the \\\"Accessibility\\\" panel before marking stories ready\\n4. Run automated checks in CI parity: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... run storybook:test`\\n\\n## Testing\\n- Unit tests (Vitest): `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test`\\n- Coverage: `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:coverage`\\n- Keyboard + a11y smoke tests (Playwright + axe): `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... test:e2e --project=design-system`\\n- Lint/type-check: `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0` and `pnpm type-check`\\n\\n## Adding a New Component\\n1. Scaffold via shadcn (`pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/frontend... exec shadcn add <component>`)\\n2. Replace default CSS classes with token-driven classes using `cn` helper and Tailwind theme extensions\\n3. Document props and states in Storybook with MDX guidelines referencing the relevant tokens\\n4. Extend Playwright spec to cover keyboard and a11y scenarios\\n5. Update `tests/design-system` Vitest suites to assert token usage contracts\\n\\n## Theme Preference\\n- Theme provider auto-reads `prefers-color-scheme`; use the UI toggle to persist overrides\\n- Stored preferences flow through `/users/me/theme-preference`; ensure Supabase session includes the JWT when testing manually\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
