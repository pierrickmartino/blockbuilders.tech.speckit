Scope: • Frontend: Set design tokens (color/typography/spacing), base components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast), dark mode, WCAG AA defaults. • Infra: Storybook with a11y coverage for tokens and components. Acceptance Criteria: • AC1: Storybook shows tokens and components with a11y checks passing. • AC2: Keyboard navigation and focus states meet WCAG AA on core components.\\\"\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Reference accessible design tokens (Priority: P1)\\n\\nProduct squads preparing new surfaces can open the shared design system workspace and select approved color, typography, and spacing tokens that already meet accessibility contrast requirements.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Without agreed tokens, teams continue to ship inconsistent UI and rework grows; this story creates the canonical source of truth.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Confirm that the tokens catalog presents all foundational categories with accessibility annotations and can be consumed to style a new page without bespoke values.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a product designer reviews the design system workspace, **When** they inspect the color tokens, **Then** every core brand color lists approved contrast pairings that satisfy WCAG AA.\\n2. **Given** a developer styling a new screen, **When** they browse the typography and spacing tokens, **Then** they find named options for headings, body copy, and layout rhythm without defining custom values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Ship accessible foundation components (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA front-end engineer adopting the design system can drop in the base Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components and know that focus handling, error states, and messaging already meet accessibility standards in both default and dark themes.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: These reusable components remove duplicated effort and lower the risk of accessibility regressions across the product.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Mount each foundation component in isolation, walk through keyboard-only flows, and verify that focus, error, and disabled states match the documented tokens in both themes.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a keyboard-only user interacting with the Button and Input components, **When** they tab through interactive states, **Then** visible focus rings and announcements remain present and meet WCAG AA contrast in default and dark modes.\\n2. **Given** a developer renders the Modal and Toast components, **When** they trigger open, close, and error paths, **Then** focus is trapped appropriately, returns to the invoking element, and status messages are conveyed in accordance with accessibility guidelines.\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n- Dark mode must respect user system preferences and fall back to default theme if tokens are missing or invalid.\\n- Components must prevent accessibility failures such as focus traps, missing announcements, or insufficient contrast when error states appear simultaneously with overlays.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n> Map each requirement to the relevant constitution principle. Explicitly list the tests, telemetry, or UX artefacts that will demonstrate compliance.\\n\\n- **FR-001**: Establish a centralized catalog of color, typography, and spacing tokens with WCAG AA-compliant defaults for light and dark variants (Principles: experience, quality). Evidence: token documentation reviewed and signed off by design and accessibility leads.\\n- **FR-002**: Document usage guidance that links each token to real component examples so teams can adopt them without bespoke styling (Principles: simplicity, experience). Evidence: cross-referenced guidelines in the design system workspace covering at least one example per token category.\\n- **FR-003**: Deliver foundation Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast components whose keyboard navigation, focus handling, and announcements meet accessibility expectations in both themes (Principles: quality, testing, experience). Evidence: manual keyboard walkthrough logs and automated accessibility reports showing zero critical issues.\\n- **FR-004**: Provide a dark theme that can be toggled per user preference while maintaining readability and parity with default theme components (Principles: experience, performance). Evidence: visual review checklist confirming parity and accessibility across representative screens.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Design Token**: Named representation of brand-approved styling attributes (color, typography, spacing) including accessibility metadata such as contrast ratios and allowed usage contexts.\\n- **Foundation Component**: Reusable UI building block (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) that consumes tokens and defines interaction states, accessibility affordances, and theming hooks.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Current product teams will adopt the new tokens and components during upcoming UI workstreams without requiring additional staffing.\\n- Accessibility acceptance is based on WCAG 2.2 AA guidance unless regulatory needs escalate beyond that baseline.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Engagement from design and accessibility reviewers to validate tokens and components.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-ACCESS**: All documented foundation components and token examples demonstrate zero critical accessibility violations and pass keyboard-only walkthroughs in both themes during launch review.\\n- **SC-CONSISTENCY**: At least five core components (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Toast) and the full token catalog are published in the design system workspace with dual-theme previews and usage notes approved by design.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
