List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

On the frontend, define the core design tokens—covering color, typography, and spacing—alongside foundational components such as Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast, ensuring dark-mode support and WCAG AA defaults. On the backend, expose a feature flag that lets teams experiment with theme variations. Infrastructure should deliver a Storybook setup with built-in accessibility checks and Chromatic-powered visual regression tests wired into CI. Success looks like: Storybook listings of tokens and components passing their accessibility checks, the visual regression job blocking merges when diffs exceed the approved threshold, and keyboard navigation plus focus states on the key components meeting WCAG AA. **DO NOT USE** files in .pierrick folder.\"\n \n ## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.\n-  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\n-  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\n-  \n-  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\n-  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\n-  - Developed independently\n-  - Tested independently\n-  - Deployed independently\n-  - Demonstrated to users independently\n-\n-  Constitution alignment: For every story call out the principles it satisfies\n-  (quality, simplicity, testing, experience, performance) and the acceptance\n-  checks that will prove compliance.\n--->\n-\n-### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., \"Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]\"]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n-2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 1 - Browse Accessible Foundations (Priority: P1)\n+\n+Design system consumers can open the component library to review the canonical color, typography, and spacing tokens alongside Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast examples that already meet WCAG AA in light and dark themes.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Without published, accessible tokens and core components, product teams cannot deliver consistent UI quickly or confidently.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Open the component library, confirm tokens are documented with contrast ratios, and interact with each showcased component to validate keyboard and focus behavior across light and dark themes.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a product designer reviewing the design system, **When** they inspect the token listings, **Then** they see accessible color palettes with their intended use cases and contrast guidance spelled out.\n+2. **Given** a frontend engineer previewing the Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast, **When** they tab through each state, **Then** focus indicators and messaging remain visible and compliant in both light and dark modes.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 2 - Pilot Theme Experiments (Priority: P2)\n+\n+Product teams can opt into a theme variation using a feature flag so they can validate updated tokens or component styling with real users before wider rollout.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Controlled rollout lowers risk when experimenting with alternate palettes or spacing, letting teams gather feedback without destabilizing the primary experience.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Toggle the feature flag in a staging environment, observe the alternate theme applying only to the targeted audience, and verify it can be turned off instantly without side effects.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a product manager preparing a thematic experiment, **When** they enable the theme variation flag for a test audience, **Then** only that audience experiences the alternate tokens and components.\n+2. **Given** feedback indicating the experiment should pause, **When** the flag is disabled, **Then** the experience immediately returns to the default theme without user disruption.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 3 -

On the frontend, define the core design tokens—covering color, typography, and spacing—alongside foundational components such as Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast, ensuring dark-mode support and WCAG AA defaults. On the backend, expose a feature flag that lets teams experiment with theme variations. Infrastructure should deliver a Storybook setup with built-in accessibility checks and Chromatic-powered visual regression tests wired into CI. Success looks like: Storybook listings of tokens and components passing their accessibility checks, the visual regression job blocking merges when diffs exceed the approved threshold, and keyboard navigation plus focus states on the key components meeting WCAG AA. **DO NOT USE** files in .pierrick folder.\"\n+\n+## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n+\n+### User Story 1 - Browse Accessible Foundations (Priority: P1)\n+\n+Design system consumers can open the component library to review the canonical color, typography, and spacing tokens alongside Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast examples that already meet WCAG AA in light and dark themes.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Without published, accessible tokens and core components, product teams cannot deliver consistent UI quickly or confidently.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Open the component library, confirm tokens are documented with contrast ratios, and interact with each showcased component to validate keyboard and focus behavior across light and dark themes.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a product designer reviewing the design system, **When** they inspect the token listings, **Then** they see accessible color palettes with their intended use cases and contrast guidance spelled out.\n+2. **Given** a frontend engineer previewing the Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast, **When** they tab through each state, **Then** focus indicators and messaging remain visible and compliant in both light and dark modes.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 2 - Pilot Theme Experiments (Priority: P2)\n+\n+Product teams can opt into a theme variation using a feature flag so they can validate updated tokens or component styling with real users before wider rollout.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Controlled rollout lowers risk when experimenting with alternate palettes or spacing, letting teams gather feedback without destabilizing the primary experience.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Toggle the feature flag in a staging environment, observe the alternate theme applying only to the targeted audience, and verify it can be turned off instantly without side effects.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a product manager preparing a thematic experiment, **When** they enable the theme variation flag for a test audience, **Then** only that audience experiences the alternate tokens and components.\n+2. **Given** feedback indicating the experiment should pause, **When** the flag is disabled, **Then** the experience immediately returns to the default theme without user disruption.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### User Story 3 - Enforce Quality Gates (Priority: P3)\n+\n+Quality and accessibility reviewers rely on automated accessibility audits and visual regression checks to block merges until issues are resolved, ensuring regressions cannot ship.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Guardrails preserve trust in the design system by catching visual or accessibility regressions before they reach production.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Run the automated checks on a component update, confirm the job fails when violations or visual diffs exceed thresholds, and verify the pipeline passes once issues are resolved or approved.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a regression introduced to focus styling, **When** the automated accessibility audit runs, **Then** the merge request is blocked with clear guidance on the violation until it is fixed.\n+2. **Given** an intentional visual change to a token, **When** the visual regression job executes, **Then** it flags the difference for review and allows the merge only after approval is recorded.\n+\n+---\n+\n+### Edge Cases\n+\n+- Dark theme backgrounds must maintain WCAG AA contrast even for warning or error states that lean on saturated colors.\n+- Component focus rings must remain visible when placed inside dense layouts or over imagery, avoiding keyboard traps in modals.\n+- Toast messaging needs to handle simultaneous notifications without obscuring primary actions or overlapping with screen-reader announcements.\n+- Feature flag rollback must gracefully restore default tokens even if a user is mid-session to prevent partial theming.\n+- Automated checks should surface actionable failures rather than timing out when the component library fails to build or network snapshots cannot be captured.\n+\n+## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n+\n+### Functional Requirements\n+\n+- **FR-001** (experience, quality): Publish a canonical set of color, typography, and spacing tokens with documented usage guidance and contrast ratios, validated through accessibility reviews recorded in the component library.\n+- **FR-002** (experience, testing): Showcase Button, Input, Select, Modal, and Toast foundations with light and dark variants that support keyboard focus, error, loading, and disabled states, demonstrated via interactive scenarios.\n+- **FR-003** (experience, performance): Ensure every showcased component maintains WCAG AA compliance for text, icons, and interactive states across light and dark themes, confirmed through scheduled accessibility audits.\n+- **FR-004** (simplicity, testing): Provide Storybook-style documentation that lists tokens and components, automatically runs accessibility checks per story, and surfaces failures to contributors prior to merge approval.\n+- **FR-005** (quality, simplicity): Integrate a visual regression gate that compares component snapshots against approved baselines and blocks merges until differences are reviewed or approved by design owners.\n+- **FR-006** (testing, experience): Record the results of accessibility and visual regression checks within the continuous integration pipeline and ensure merge approvals require passing results or explicit waivers.\n+- **FR-007** (experience, safety): Offer a feature flag that enables targeted audiences to experience alternative theme tokens and allows instant rollback, with change history auditable by product leadership.\n+\n+### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n+\n+- **Design Token**: Named definition for color, typography, or spacing that includes purpose, contrast guidance, and relationships to supported modes.\n+- **Theme Variation**: Set of alternate token values associated with a feature flag audience and lifecycle status (draft, in pilot, sunset).\n+- **Component Showcase**: Documented scenario combining tokens and component states, capturing accessibility audit results and baseline imagery for regression comparisons.\n+- **Quality Gate Record**: Summary of automated accessibility and visual regression outcomes stored with timestamp, reviewer, and resolution status.\n+\n+## Assumptions\n+\n+- Existing continuous integration tooling can host accessibility and visual regression checks without requiring new vendor procurement.\n+- Product teams have capacity to pilot theme variations and provide structured feedback within the release window.\n+- Accessibility reviewers are available to spot-check keyboard navigation and focus management before sign-off.\n+\n+## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n+\n+### Measurable Outcomes\n+\n+- **SC-A11Y**: Accessibility audits of tokens and foundational components report zero unresolved WCAG AA violations across light and dark themes for two consecutive releases.\n+- **SC-USG**: At least two product squads confirm they can deliver a production-ready flow using only the published tokens and components, with feedback captured in release notes.\n+- **SC-REG**: Visual regression runs block 100% of merge attempts containing unreviewed diffs, and release readiness reports show no outstanding visual approvals at sign-off.\n+- **SC-ADPT**: Feature flag metrics show that theme experiments can be enabled and rolled back within 15 minutes, with no customer-facing incidents recorded during pilots.\n*** End Patch"}}
